# HNN_Daydreamer

Project title: Daydreaming on Hopfield and Potts neural networks

We intend to implement the daydreaming algorithm (as described in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608025000954), first on a Hopfield neural network, and then on a q-state Potts neural network. We will test the effects of the daydreaming algorithm by visualizing and comparing the success of the networks (with and without daydreaming) at [FILL IN HERE, image reconstruction maybe?, data compression and searching? idk]. 
   
The planned directory structure is as follows: \
<pre> 
    /README.md 
    /HNN.py          #implementation of the hopfield neural net, with and without daydreaming 
    /qPottsNN.py     #implementation of q-state potts neurla net, with and without daydreaming 
    /viz.py          #functions for visualizing/plotting the network 
    /ref_data.py     #reference data to test neural, either imported or hardcoded
    /results.ipynb   #jupyter notebook displaying results for each NN
</pre>
Chronological steps to complete the project: 
- Implement Hopfield NN (lots of publically avaiable code, should be easy to start with)
- Implement daydreaming algorithm on HNN
- Implement q-state Potts NN
- Implement daydreaming algorithm on qPNN
- At some point create several visualization fuctions to test/compare NN output [??]

Instructions:    
    - Project Title
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the project. What is the problem you are solving, and what is the main idea of your solution?
    
    - A list of the planned directory structure of the project. For example, many projects might use a top-level demo.ipynb file that shows a minimal example of the project working, and then call a subdirectory src/project_name.py that contains the main code implementation. Some projects might have a data directory that contains the data files needed to run the project, or a results directory that contains the results of the project. What you include here entirely up to you and your project, the goal here is to make sure you have a plan for the project’s components and structure and how to break them apart into manageable pieces.
    
    - 2-5 bullet points describing the planned chronological steps to complete the project, including the main code you plan to write, what other implementations are available if you plan to build on top of them, and what other components you plan to add.
    
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the planned contributions of each team member.
    
    - Any additional notes, references, or information that you think is relevant to the project and necessary for someone else to understand your project.
    
    - You can change all of this later, the README at this stage is so that the course staff can understand your project and give you feedback on your plan, if needed.
