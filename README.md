# HNN_Daydreamer

Include in README:
    - The title of the project.
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the project. What is the problem you are solving, and what is the main idea of your solution?
    - A list of the planned directory structure of the project. For example, many projects might use a top-level demo.ipynb file that shows a minimal example of the project working, and then call a subdirectory src/project_name.py that contains the main code implementation. Some projects might have a data directory that contains the data files needed to run the project, or a results directory that contains the results of the project. What you include here entirely up to you and your project, the goal here is to make sure you have a plan for the project’s components and structure and how to break them apart into manageable pieces.
    - 2-5 bullet points describing the planned chronological steps to complete the project, including the main code you plan to write, what other implementations are available if you plan to build on top of them, and what other components you plan to add.
    - A 1-2 sentence description of the planned contributions of each team member.
    - Any additional notes, references, or information that you think is relevant to the project and necessary for someone else to understand your project.
    - You can change all of this later, the README at this stage is so that the course staff can understand your project and give you feedback on your plan, if needed.
